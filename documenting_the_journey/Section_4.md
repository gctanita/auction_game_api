## Step 4: Ok, so let's add logic to this. Let's start with creating a new user... 

In order to create a new user, the flow will be this:
- The user makes a POST with create_user
  - username
  - password
  - pocket_money (optional)

A bank account needs to be generated for the user. A new api key as a UUID will be generated. 

My promt:

```
In JavaScript I need a function that will:
- insert a new entry in bank_accounts with value "0" for amount field
- get the id of the new entry from bank_accounts
- generate a random UUID string
- insert a new entry in the users table, with the name and password received as parameters, the generated uuid string for the apikey, the id of the bank for bank_account_id, and value 100 for pocket_money
```

``` JavaScript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid'); // to generate UUID
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise'); // assuming you're using mysql2 with promises

async function createNewUser(dbConnection, username, password) {
    try {
        // Start a transaction
        await dbConnection.beginTransaction();

        // Step 1: Insert into bank_accounts with amount 0
        const [bankResult] = await dbConnection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO bank_accounts (amount) VALUES (0)'
        );
        
        // Get the id of the newly inserted bank account
        const bankAccountId = bankResult.insertId;

        // Step 2: Generate a UUID for the apikey
        const apikey = uuidv4();

        // Step 3: Insert into users table
        const pocketMoney = 100; // set default pocket money
        await dbConnection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO users (username, password, apikey, bank_account_id, pocket_money) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
            [username, password, apikey, bankAccountId, pocketMoney]
        );

        // Commit the transaction
        await dbConnection.commit();

        console.log('User created successfully with bank account ID:', bankAccountId);
    } catch (error) {
        // Rollback the transaction in case of error
        await dbConnection.rollback();
        console.error('Error creating user:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}

// Usage Example
(async () => {
    const dbConnection = await mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'root',
        password: 'password',
        database: 'your_database'
    });

    try {
        await createNewUser(dbConnection, 'testuser', 'testpassword');
    } finally {
        await dbConnection.end();
    }
})();
```

Certainly! Below is a JavaScript function that performs the steps you've outlined:

- Inserts a new entry into the bank_accounts table with an amount of "0".
- Retrieves the id of the newly inserted bank account.
- Generates a random UUID string for the apikey.
- Inserts a new entry into the users table with:
  - The provided username and password.
  - The generated apikey.
  - The retrieved bank_account_id.
  - A pocket_money value of 100.


**Important Note**: For security reasons, it's highly recommended to hash passwords before storing them in the database. The code below uses plain text for simplicity but should be adjusted accordingly for production use.

```javascript
// Required modules
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

// Async function to create a new user
async function createUser(username, password) {
    // Database connection configuration
    const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'localhost',         // Replace with your host
        user: 'your_db_user',      // Replace with your database user
        password: 'your_db_pass',  // Replace with your database password
        database: 'your_db_name'   // Replace with your database name
    });

    try {
        // Start a transaction
        await connection.beginTransaction();

        // Step 1: Insert into bank_accounts
        const [bankResult] = await connection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO bank_accounts (amount) VALUES (?)',
            [0]
        );

        // Step 2: Retrieve bank_account_id
        const bankAccountId = bankResult.insertId;

        // Step 3: Generate a random UUID for apikey
        const apiKey = uuidv4();

        // Step 4: Insert into users table
        const [userResult] = await connection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO users (username, password, apikey, bank_account_id, pocket_money) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
            [username, password, apiKey, bankAccountId, 100]
        );

        // Commit the transaction
        await connection.commit();

        console.log('User created successfully with ID:', userResult.insertId);
        return {
            userId: userResult.insertId,
            apiKey: apiKey
        };
    } catch (error) {
        // Rollback the transaction in case of error
        await connection.rollback();
        console.error('Error creating user:', error);
        throw error;
    } finally {
        // Close the database connection
        await connection.end();
    }
}

// Example usage
createUser('exampleUser', 'examplePassword')
    .then(result => {
        console.log('New user details:', result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    });
```

## Explanation:
### Dependencies:
- mysql2/promise: A Node.js driver for MySQL with Promise support, allowing the use of async/await syntax.
- uuid: A library for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).

Install these dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install mysql2 uuid
```

## Function Breakdown:
### Database Connection:

```javascript
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_db_user',
    password: 'your_db_pass',
    database: 'your_db_name'
});
```

- Replace 'your_db_user', 'your_db_pass', and 'your_db_name' with your actual database credentials.
Transaction Initiation:

```javascript
await connection.beginTransaction();
```

- Starts a transaction to ensure that all operations complete successfully before committing to the database.

### Inserting into bank_accounts:

``` javascript
const [bankResult] = await connection.execute(
    'INSERT INTO bank_accounts (amount) VALUES (?)',
    [0]
);
```

- Inserts a new bank account with an amount of 0.
- The insertId from bankResult is the new bank_account_id.

### Generating a UUID for apikey:

``` javascript
const apiKey = uuidv4();
```

- Generates a random UUID to be used as the user's API key.

### Inserting into users:

``` javascript
const [userResult] = await connection.execute(
    'INSERT INTO users (username, password, apikey, bank_account_id, pocket_money) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
    [username, password, apiKey, bankAccountId, 100]
);
```

Inserts a new user with the provided username and password.
Associates the new user with the bank_account_id obtained earlier.
Sets the pocket_money to 100.
Committing the Transaction:

```javascript
await connection.commit();
```
- Commits all the changes to the database.


### Error Handling:

```javascript
await connection.rollback();
```

- If any error occurs, the transaction is rolled back to maintain data integrity.


### Closing the Connection:

```javascript
await connection.end();
```

- Ensures the database connection is properly closed after operations are complete.

## Security Considerations:
### Password Hashing:

- Do not store plain-text passwords. Always hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt.

- Implementing Password Hashing:

- Install bcrypt:

```bash
npm install bcrypt
```

- Modify the createUser function:


```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

// ...

// Before inserting the password
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

// Use hashedPassword instead of password in the insert statement
const [userResult] = await connection.execute(
    'INSERT INTO users (username, password, apikey, bank_account_id, pocket_money) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
    [username, hashedPassword, apiKey, bankAccountId, 100]
);
```

## Input Validation:

Validate username and password to prevent SQL injection and ensure they meet your application's requirements (e.g., minimum length, allowed characters).

### Example Usage:
```javascript
createUser('john_doe', 'securePassword123')
    .then(result => {
        console.log('User created successfully:', result);
        // Output: User created successfully: { userId: 1, apiKey: 'generated-uuid' }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error creating user:', error);
    });
```

## Additional Recommendations:
### Connection Pooling:

For better performance and resource management in a production environment, use a connection pool instead of creating a new connection for each operation.

```javascript
const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_db_user',
    password: 'your_db_pass',
    database: 'your_db_name',
    waitForConnections: true,
    connectionLimit: 10,
    queueLimit: 0
});

// Then use pool.getConnection() instead of mysql.createConnection()
```

### Environment Variables:

Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables instead of hardcoding them.

```javascript
const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASS,
    database: process.env.DB_NAME
});
```

### Error Logging:

Implement proper error logging mechanisms to monitor and debug issues effectively.

### API Key Management:

Ensure the generated API keys are securely stored and transmitted over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS).

## Conclusion:
This function efficiently creates a new user with an associated bank account and a unique API key in your database. Remember to implement proper security measures like password hashing and input validation before deploying this code to a production environment.

## Personal comments
The 4o model responded in a script with the DB connection separate from the rest of the code, the o1 did not. However, the reply from o1-preview had very usefull elements, like:

- password hashing
- input validations
- connection pooling for the DB
- moving the sensitive data to another file

However these suggestions were not tied in together, and it was not intuitive on how to tie them together with existing code. Since this experiment wishes to follow the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid), and allow people the possibility to refactor, I just cherry picked the elements from 4o, and tied them together.
