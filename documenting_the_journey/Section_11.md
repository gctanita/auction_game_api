# Step 11: Get auction items
    - GET auction_items
    - list of items, with end date

Ok, soo... Damn... end_date... uell... didn't put that in section 10 didn't i? (Of course I didn't)...

Then, let's make a plan:
1. modify the code we wrote in section 11 to include the end date:
    - modify the DB
    - modify the function that makes the insert

2. create a function that obtains the list of items that are up for auction
3. write the API call for GET auction_items

## 1. Adding the end_date 

Prompt: 
> Modify the table "auction_items_on_display" to include an extra column named end_date

The 4o model gabe me the alter table SQL, and that's it.
The o1-preview model:
- gave the alter table SQL
- talked about nullability
- talked about setting a default value for the column
- told me how to update the existing records
- told me how to index 

For our implementation i will choose the alter table with a default value for the column:
```SQL
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```

<details>
    <summary>o1-preview</summary>

Certainly! To modify the auction_items_on_display table and add an extra column named end_date, you can use the following SQL ALTER TABLE statement:

```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME;
```

## Explanation:
### Data Type Selection:
- DATETIME Data Type:
  - The DATETIME data type is suitable for storing both date and time information, which is ideal for an auction end date that includes the exact timestamp when the auction ends.
  - If you only need to store the date without the time, you can use the DATE data type:
```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATE;
```
### Nullability:
- Allowing NULL Values:
  - By default, the new end_date column will allow NULL values. This means existing records won't be affected immediately.
- Setting NOT NULL:
  - If you want to ensure that every record has an end_date, you can add the NOT NULL constraint:
```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME NOT NULL;
```
   - Important: If you set NOT NULL, you must provide a default value or update existing records to include an end_date; otherwise, the command will fail if the table already contains data.

### Default Value:
- Setting a Default Value:
  - You can set a default value for the end_date column using the DEFAULT keyword. For example, to set the default end_date to 7 days from the current date and time:
```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```
  - Note: MySQL versions prior to 8.0.13 do not support expressions as default values. In such cases, you need to handle default values within your application logic.

### Updating Existing Records:
If you have existing records in the auction_items_on_display table, you'll need to update them to include an end_date before enforcing a NOT NULL constraint.

```sql
-- Step 1: Add the column allowing NULL values
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME;

-- Step 2: Update existing records to have an end_date
UPDATE auction_items_on_display
SET end_date = NOW() + INTERVAL 7 DAY
WHERE end_date IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Modify the column to set NOT NULL constraint
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
MODIFY COLUMN end_date DATETIME NOT NULL;
```
### Indexing (Optional):
If you plan to query or sort the auction_items_on_display table based on the end_date, consider adding an index to improve performance:

```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD INDEX idx_end_date (end_date);
```
## Considerations:
- Existing Data:
  - Ensure you handle existing records appropriately, especially if you're adding a NOT NULL constraint.
- Application Logic:
  - Update your application to provide an end_date value when inserting new records into auction_items_on_display.
- Data Integrity:
  - Using DATETIME allows you to set precise auction end times, which can be critical for auction functionality.
## Summary:
- Add the end_date Column:
  - Use ALTER TABLE to add the new column with the appropriate data type.
- Handle Nullability and Defaults:
  - Decide whether the column should allow NULL values or have a default value.
- Update Existing Records:
  - If necessary, update existing records to comply with new constraints.
- Optimize Performance:
  - Consider indexing the end_date column if it will be used frequently in queries.

<details>
    <summary>o4</summary>

To modify the auction_items_on_display table by adding a new column called end_date, which could represent the date when the auction ends, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display
ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME;
```
## Explanation
- ALTER TABLE auction_items_on_display: This statement modifies the existing auction_items_on_display table.
- ADD COLUMN end_date DATETIME: This adds a new column named end_date of type DATETIME, which can store both date and time values.

This new column end_date will allow you to set an auction end date for each item in the auction_items_on_display table. You can adjust the DATETIME type if you need more specific handling, such as using DATE (for date only) or TIMESTAMP (if timezone information is important).
</details>

To be honest I can't imagine how to formulate the prompt to modify the code. Probably because it's an extremly simple change. So, I will add in the `POST move_item_to_auction` 2 extra parameters: hours and minutes. To set the expiry date in X hours and Y minutes.

From:
```javascript
 const {apiKey, itemId, startingValue} = req.body;
 ```
 To
 ```javascript
 const {apiKey, itemId, startingValue, hours, minutes} = req.body;
 ```

 I need to calculate the end date, and for this I will write a prompt:
PROMPT:
> In Javascript, I need to calculate the date after today + "hours" and "minutes"

As a human, i don't really understand what this prompt wants from me, so let's see what the 2 models understand from it. 4o understood what I meant and gave me a small function to do this. The o1-preview, gave once again a huge response, and tried to integrate it in the existing code that we have as well. 

I'll take the answer from 4o and integrate in our code:

From:
```javascript
    const result = await moveItemToAuction(dbConnection, itemId, itemRows[0].owner_id, startingValue);
 ```
 To
 ```javascript
    let end_date = new Date();
    end_date.setHours(end_date.getHours() + hours);
    end_date.setMinutes(end_date.getMinutes() + minutes);

    // Move the item to auction
    const result = await moveItemToAuction(dbConnection, itemId, itemRows[0].owner_id, startingValue, end_date);
 ```

And now to modify the function:
From
```javascript
    function moveItemToAuction(dbConnection, itemId, originalOwnerId, initialValue) {
 ```
 To
 ```javascript
    function moveItemToAuction(dbConnection, itemId, originalOwnerId, initialValue, end_date) {
 ```

And
<br>
From
```javascript
    await dbConnection.execute(
            `INSERT INTO auction_items_on_display (item_id, original_owner_id, max_bidder, max_sum)
             VALUES (?, ?, NULL, ?)`,
            [itemId, originalOwnerId, initialValue]
        );
 ```
 To
 ```javascript
    await dbConnection.execute(
            `INSERT INTO auction_items_on_display (item_id, original_owner_id, max_bidder, max_sum, end_date)
             VALUES (?, ?, NULL, ?, ?)`,
            [itemId, originalOwnerId, initialValue, end_date]
        );
 ```

 I will include only the first part to calculate the function, both models produced it, and won't put the full text from o1-preview overkill:
 ```javascript
 function calculateFutureDate(hours, minutes) {
    // Get the current date and time
    const now = new Date();

    // Calculate the future date by adding hours and minutes
    now.setHours(now.getHours() + hours);
    now.setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + minutes);

    return now;
}
```


## 2. Let's get the list of items for auction

PROMPT:
> Make a function to get from the DB the list of items up for auction: item id, item name, item description, attack_modifier, defense_modifier, magic_modifier, bonus_effect_1_name, bonus_effect_1_description, bonus_effect_2_name, bonus_effect_2_description, bonus_effect_3_name, bonus_effect_3_description, current_max_bid, end_date
  
The response from 4o integrates with the existing arhitecture of our app. 

This resulted in adding the function that does the work:
```javascript
async function getAuctionItems(dbConnection) {
    try {
        const [auctionItems] = await dbConnection.execute(
            `
            SELECT 
                items.id AS item_id,
                items.name AS item_name,
                items.description AS item_description,
                items.attack_modifier,
                items.defense_modifier,
                items.magic_modifier,
                bonus1.effect_name AS bonus_effect_1_name,
                bonus1.effect_description AS bonus_effect_1_description,
                bonus2.effect_name AS bonus_effect_2_name,
                bonus2.effect_description AS bonus_effect_2_description,
                bonus3.effect_name AS bonus_effect_3_name,
                bonus3.effect_description AS bonus_effect_3_description,
                auction_items_on_display.max_sum AS current_max_bid,
                auction_items_on_display.end_date
            FROM 
                auction_items_on_display
            JOIN items ON auction_items_on_display.item_id = items.id
            LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS bonus1 ON items.bonus_effect_1_id = bonus1.id
            LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS bonus2 ON items.bonus_effect_2_id = bonus2.id
            LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS bonus3 ON items.bonus_effect_3_id = bonus3.id
            WHERE 
                auction_items_on_display.end_date > NOW()
            `
        );

        return { success: true, items: auctionItems };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching auction items:', error);
        return { success: false, message: 'Failed to retrieve auction items.' };
    }
}
```
and the API call:
```javascript
app.get('/auction_items', async (req, res) => {
    const {apiKey} = req.query;

    if (!apiKey) {
        return res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'apiKey is required.' });
    }

    // Validate apiKey and get userId
    try {
        (async () => {
            const dbConnection = await mysql.createConnection(DB_CONNECTION_DATA);
            try {
                
                const result = await getAuctionItems(dbConnection);

                if (result.success) {
                    return res.status(200).json({ success: true, items: result.items });
                } else {
                    return res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: result.message });
                }
            } finally {
                await dbConnection.end();
            }
        })();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in /auction_items:', error.message);
    return res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'An error occurred while fetching items up for auction.' });
    }
});
```

Thought for 7 seconds

Certainly! Below is a JavaScript function that retrieves the list of items up for auction from your database, including all the specified details:
- Item ID
- Item Name
- Item Description
- Attack Modifier
- Defense Modifier
- Magic Modifier
- Bonus Effect 1 Name
- Bonus Effect 1 Description
- Bonus Effect 2 Name
- Bonus Effect 2 Description
- Bonus Effect 3 Name
- Bonus Effect 3 Description
- Current Max Bid
- End Date

The function connects to the database, executes a SQL query that joins the necessary tables, and returns the list of auction items with the requested details.

```javascript
// Required modules
const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');

// Database configuration (replace with your actual credentials)
const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_db_user',      // Replace with your DB user
    password: 'your_db_pass',  // Replace with your DB password
    database: 'your_db_name'   // Replace with your DB name
};

// Function to get the list of items up for auction
async function getAuctionItems() {
    let connection;

    try {
        // Create a database connection
        connection = await mysql.createConnection(dbConfig);

        // SQL query to retrieve auction items with all required details
        const [auctionItems] = await connection.execute(
            `
            SELECT
                items.id AS item_id,
                items.name AS item_name,
                items.description AS item_description,
                items.attack_modifier,
                items.defense_modifier,
                items.magic_modifier,
                be1.effect_name AS bonus_effect_1_name,
                be1.effect_description AS bonus_effect_1_description,
                be2.effect_name AS bonus_effect_2_name,
                be2.effect_description AS bonus_effect_2_description,
                be3.effect_name AS bonus_effect_3_name,
                be3.effect_description AS bonus_effect_3_description,
                auction_items_on_display.max_sum AS current_max_bid,
                auction_items_on_display.end_date
            FROM
                auction_items_on_display
                INNER JOIN items ON auction_items_on_display.item_id = items.id
                LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be1 ON items.bonus_effect_1_id = be1.id
                LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be2 ON items.bonus_effect_2_id = be2.id
                LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be3 ON items.bonus_effect_3_id = be3.id
            WHERE
                auction_items_on_display.end_date > NOW()
            ORDER BY
                auction_items_on_display.end_date ASC
            `
        );

        // Return the list of auction items
        return auctionItems;

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error retrieving auction items:', error);
        throw error;
    } finally {
        if (connection) {
            await connection.end();
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
getAuctionItems()
    .then(items => {
        console.log('Auction Items:', items);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
    });
```
## Explanation:
1. Import Required Modules:
   - mysql2/promise: Used for connecting to and querying the MySQL database asynchronously.
2. Database Configuration:
   - dbConfig: Holds the database connection parameters.
      - Important: Replace 'your_db_user', 'your_db_pass', and 'your_db_name' with your actual database credentials.
3. Function getAuctionItems():
   - Purpose: Retrieves the list of items currently up for auction, including all specified details.
   - Process:
     - Establish a Database Connection:
```javascript
connection = await mysql.createConnection(dbConfig);
```
- Execute the SQL Query:
```javascript
const [auctionItems] = await connection.execute(`...`);
```
- SQL Query Breakdown:
  - SELECT Clause: Selects all the required fields, including aliases for clarity.
```sql
SELECT
    items.id AS item_id,
    items.name AS item_name,
    items.description AS item_description,
    items.attack_modifier,
    items.defense_modifier,
    items.magic_modifier,
    be1.effect_name AS bonus_effect_1_name,
    be1.effect_description AS bonus_effect_1_description,
    be2.effect_name AS bonus_effect_2_name,
    be2.effect_description AS bonus_effect_2_description,
    be3.effect_name AS bonus_effect_3_name,
    be3.effect_description AS bonus_effect_3_description,
    auction_items_on_display.max_sum AS current_max_bid,
    auction_items_on_display.end_date
```

- FROM Clause: Specifies the main table and joins.
   - auction_items_on_display: The main table containing items currently on auction.
   - INNER JOIN items: Joins the items table to get item details.
   - LEFT JOIN bonus_effects: Joins the bonus_effects table for each possible bonus effect.
     - be1: For bonus_effect_1_id.
     - be2: For bonus_effect_2_id.
     - be3: For bonus_effect_3_id.
```sql
FROM
    auction_items_on_display
    INNER JOIN items ON auction_items_on_display.item_id = items.id
    LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be1 ON items.bonus_effect_1_id = be1.id
    LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be2 ON items.bonus_effect_2_id = be2.id
    LEFT JOIN bonus_effects AS be3 ON items.bonus_effect_3_id = be3.id
```

- WHERE Clause: Filters out items whose auction has ended.
```sql
WHERE
    auction_items_on_display.end_date > NOW()
```

- ORDER BY Clause: Orders the results by the auction end date in ascending order.
```sql
Copy code
ORDER BY
    auction_items_on_display.end_date ASC
```

- Return the List of Auction Items:
  - The function returns the auctionItems array, which contains the result of the query.
4. Error Handling:
   - Errors are caught and logged to the console.
   - The error is re-thrown to allow the calling code to handle it appropriately.
5. Connection Cleanup:
   - The database connection is closed in the finally block to ensure it closes even if an error occurs.

## Database Schema Assumptions:
- auction_items_on_display Table:
   - Columns:
     - id
     - item_id (foreign key to items.id)
     - original_owner_id
     - max_bidder
     - max_sum (current max bid)
     - end_date
- items Table:
   - Columns:
     - id
     - name
     - description
     - attack_modifier
     - defense_modifier
     - magic_modifier
     - bonus_effect_1_id (foreign key to bonus_effects.id)
     - bonus_effect_2_id (foreign key to bonus_effects.id)
     - bonus_effect_3_id (foreign key to bonus_effects.id)
     - Other item-related fields
- bonus_effects Table:
   - Columns:
     - id
     - effect_name
     - effect_description


## Sample Output:
Assuming there are auction items in the database, the output might look like:
```json
[
  {
    "item_id": 42,
    "item_name": "Mystic Sword of Flames",
    "item_description": "A sword imbued with the essence of fire.",
    "attack_modifier": 5,
    "defense_modifier": 2,
    "magic_modifier": 3,
    "bonus_effect_1_name": "Fire Damage",
    "bonus_effect_1_description": "Adds fire damage to attacks.",
    "bonus_effect_2_name": null,
    "bonus_effect_2_description": null,
    "bonus_effect_3_name": null,
    "bonus_effect_3_description": null,
    "current_max_bid": 150,
    "end_date": "2023-10-20T15:30:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "item_id": 43,
    "item_name": "Enchanted Shield of Fortitude",
    "item_description": "A shield that bolsters the bearer's resilience.",
    "attack_modifier": 1,
    "defense_modifier": 5,
    "magic_modifier": 2,
    "bonus_effect_1_name": "Damage Reduction",
    "bonus_effect_1_description": "Reduces incoming damage by 10%.",
    "bonus_effect_2_name": "Health Regeneration",
    "bonus_effect_2_description": "Regenerates health over time.",
    "bonus_effect_3_name": null,
    "bonus_effect_3_description": null,
    "current_max_bid": 200,
    "end_date": "2023-10-21T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Integration with an Express.js Endpoint:
If you want to expose this functionality via an API endpoint, you can set up an Express.js route:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Assuming getAuctionItems function is defined as above

app.get('/auction_items', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const items = await getAuctionItems();
        res.status(200).json({ items });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'An error occurred while retrieving auction items.' });
    }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Usage:
- Start the server and make a GET request to /auction_items.
- Example URL: http://localhost:3000/auction_items

## Additional Considerations:
1. Time Zones and Date Formats:
   - Date Objects:
     - The end_date returned from the database is in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).
     - When displaying dates to users, consider converting them to the user's local time zone.
2. Handling Null Bonus Effects:
   - If an item doesn't have a bonus effect (i.e., bonus_effect_*_id is NULL), the corresponding bonus effect name and description will be NULL.
3. Security Practices:
   - Parameterized Queries:
     - Using parameterized queries (?) to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Error Handling:
Avoid exposing detailed error information to clients in production environments.
4. Performance Optimization:
   - Indexing:
     - Ensure that relevant columns (item_id, end_date, etc.) are indexed for efficient querying.
5. Filtering and Pagination:
   - If the number of auction items is large, consider implementing pagination or allowing filtering based on certain criteria (e.g., item type, end date).
## Conclusion:
The provided function getAuctionItems retrieves all the auction items from the database, including detailed information about each item and its bonus effects. By integrating this function into your application, you can display an up-to-date list of items currently up for auction to your users.

    <summary>o4</summary>

Here's a JavaScript function that retrieves the list of items up for auction from the database. This function assumes a MySQL connection and uses a SQL query with JOIN operations to gather item details, bonus effect information, the current maximum bid, and the auction end date.

The query will pull fields including item details (ID, name, description, modifiers), up to three bonus effects (name and description), the current maximum bid, and the auction end date.

## Explanation
- SQL Query:
  - JOIN: This query joins the auction_items_on_display and items tables based on the item ID.
  - LEFT JOIN for Bonus Effects: The query performs a LEFT JOIN with the bonus_effects table three times, once for each possible bonus effect, to retrieve their names and descriptions if they exist.
  - Filter Active Auctions: WHERE auction_items_on_display.end_date > NOW() filters out expired auctions, showing only active items up for auction.
- Returned Object:
  - If successful, the function returns an object with success: true and auctionItems, containing details about each item up for auction.
  - In case of an error, the function returns success: false with an error message.
## Example Usage
```javascript
(async () => {
    const dbConnection = await mysql.createConnection({
        host: 'localhost',
        user: 'root',
        password: 'password',
        database: 'your_database'
    });

    try {
        const result = await getAuctionItems(dbConnection);
        console.log(result);
    } finally {
        await dbConnection.end();
    }
})();
```
## Example Output
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "auctionItems": [
        {
            "item_id": 101,
            "item_name": "Flaming Sword of the Inferno",
            "item_description": "A weapon forged in ancient flames, it burns all it touches.",
            "attack_modifier": 3,
            "defense_modifier": 2,
